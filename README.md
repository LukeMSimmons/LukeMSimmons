## Intro
Hello, my name is Luke.  Thanks for visiting my GitHub account.  I have added, and will continue to add, some abstracted skill demos on here that I think showcase some valuable tools/skills. Please check out my **[skill_exhibition](https://github.com/LukeMSimmons/skill_exhibition)** repo for more. 

## Toolkit
Python in VS Code & JupyterLab (libraries: pyodbc, sqlalchemy, dask,
snowflake.connector, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, and user-defined classes/methods),
SQL (Snowflake, SQL Server & via ODBC/sqlalchemy in Python), Tableau, IBM Cloud, AWS.

## I am skilled in.. 
Environment creation, data aggregation with high volume/variety assets, data cleaning /
preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, ETL process development, light ML/Modeling (common
regression/classification methods), data visualization, KPI research, report development / dashboarding,
root cause analysis, stack trace debugging, production of reusable modules & abstracted code intended
for an iterative Agile framework.

## I am interested in developing my skills in.. 
pyspark, advanced ML, & applied bayesian reasoning. I also want to get better at quick web app style dashboards using Mercury, Flask, or maybe just Holoviews in JupyterLab.
