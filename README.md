## Intro
Hello, Iâ€™m Luke.  I Thanks for checking out some of my publicly available stuff. Most of my projects are work-related, so I'm working on adding some abstracted skill demos on here. Check out my skill_exhibition repo for more. 

## Toolkit
GitHub, Conda, Python in VS Code & JupyterLab (libraries: pyodbc, sqlalchemy, dask,
snowflake.connector, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, and user-defined classes/methods),
SQL (Snowflake, SQL Server & via ODBC/sqlalchemy in Python), Tableau, IBM Cloud, AWS.

## I am skilled in.. 
Environment creation, data aggregation with high volume/variety assets, data cleaning /
preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, ETL process development, light ML/Modeling (common
regression/classification methods), data visualization, KPI research, report development / dashboarding,
root cause analysis, stack trace debugging, production of reusable modules & abstracted code intended
for an iterative Agile framework.

## I am interested in developing my skills in.. 
pyspark, advanced ML, & applied bayesian reasoning. I also want to get better at quick web app style dashboards using Mercury, Flask, or maybe just Holoviews in JupyterLab.
